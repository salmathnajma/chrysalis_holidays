                    Version 4.2 brings many very important features and updates, and this release has been entirely driven by the user feedback gathered over the last few months for both Pro and Free versions of the plugin.

                <h3>Shortcodes Builder</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the past few years, shortcodes have proven a bit of a problem, and many users had trouble keeping up with how the shortcodes need to be configured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is all now in the past, and new Shortcodes Builder is easy to use panel showing all available shortcodes with options to generate shortcodes from the interface listing available attributes and settings. Generated shortcodes are optimized for length by avoiding the default values.

                <h3>Improved Rich Snippets</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest issues with snippets is that Google has made very big changes in relation to ratings last year. Since then, few plugin versions were dealing with snippets, and this new update focuses on further improvements to snippets implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plugin has new 'Custom' snippet type allowing you to define any snippet type and include auto generated data. Plugin also has updated global settings panel with more flexibility for configuring global settings.

                <p>
                    Major issue since the version 4.0 (and 3.0 Lite) were released was related to Posts Addon for automatic inclusion of ratings inside the post content. Conflicts were discovered with some SEO plugins, and this version brings many improvements and fixes aiming to improve automatic rating blocks insertion.
